### **Purpose:**

Before studying IT, I was an architect and also did graphic design for one year. Without any IT background, this website can fully show potential employers what I have learned in the course, as well as my personality and skills.

---

### **Functionality and Features**
The majority of the site is based on a single page.
The main page is divided into 4 sections which are:
- About
- Project
- Blog
- Contact
The large heading separates each section, allowing users to quickly find the section of interest.

#### **Navigation**
The navigation bar across all pages of the webstie. It is responsive, meaning it will adjust its size and behaviour based on the screen size.

 The logo is used as a quick return to the main page from anywhere in the site. when the user first time open the page that will show a animation next to the logo.

#### **Hamburger Menu-Navigation**

The hamburger menu displays links to the other parts of the site in a vertical list instead. When the screen size drops below 800px, The navigation bar transforms into a hamburger navigation when the website is viewed on a mobile device. The menu is designed with a transparent background for enhanced design style.

The Back-to-top navigation that takes users to the top of the page at any section for improved convenience.It is fixed in the bottom right corner over the website and doesn’t scroll with the rest of the site.
