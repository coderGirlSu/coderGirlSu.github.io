                <p>Recipe sites have gotten so bloated that you need to read someone's entire life story to get the
                    ingredients
                    and
                    steps. I'm a big fan of storing information in plain text in git, as well as [[cooking]], so I was
                    happy to
                    discover CookLang.

                    I don't want to write my recipes in completely unstructured text, because then I can't do
                    interesting things
                    like generate shopping lists, convert units, get required cookware, etc. I also don't want to write
                    them in
                    a
                    highly structured format like JSON because it would be too difficult to read and maintain.

                    I like cooklang because you can read it like a recipe if you want. I also like that you can list the
                    ingredients
                    throughout the steps and it automatically builds an ingredients list. This way you don't have to
                    maintain a
                    dedicated ingredients list and it's easier to update.
