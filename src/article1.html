    <p>Recipe sites have gotten so bloated that you need to read someone's entire life story to get the ingredients and
        steps. I'm a big fan of storing information in plain text in git, as well as [[cooking]], so I was happy to
        discover CookLang.

        I don't want to write my recipes in completely unstructured text, because then I can't do interesting things
        like generate shopping lists, convert units, get required cookware, etc. I also don't want to write them in a
        highly structured format like JSON because it would be too difficult to read and maintain.

        I like cooklang because you can read it like a recipe if you want. I also like that you can list the ingredients
        throughout the steps and it automatically builds an ingredients list. This way you don't have to maintain a
        dedicated ingredients list and it's easier to update.
